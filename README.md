# SQL_Coffee_Shop_Project
In this project, I explored the sales data of a coffee shop using SQL. The goal was to perform in-depth analysis by writing queries that uncover key business insights. By calculating total revenue, identifying the most popular and high-revenue products, and analyzing order patterns, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of the shop's sales performance. This kind of data-driven analysis is crucial for making informed business decisions.
